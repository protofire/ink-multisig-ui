# XSigners Multisig UI

This repository houses a user-friendly interface built with Next.js for interacting with a Multi-Signature (MultiSig) smart contract in the Polkadot ecosystem. The smart contract, written in ink!, allows multiple owners to propose, approve, or reject transactions, which are executed only upon meeting an approval threshold. The UI provides an intuitive way to manage owners, adjust the approval threshold, and handle transactions, each assigned a unique ID. The interface aims to simplify the user interaction with complex MultiSig contract functionalities, thereby promoting a more accessible Polkadot ecosystem.

  docker-compose --env-file .docker/squid/.env_squid up
  ```

- If you prefer running the app without a local Squid node, you can do the following:

  1. Open the .docker/web/.env_web file.
  2. Modify the NEXT_SHIBUYA_GQL_ENDPOINT variable to point to the provided test node.
  3. Run the app using the command:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --no-deps web
  ```

> To stop the application, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Local Stack

- Install the dependencies with `yarn`
- Run the app with `yarn dev`

### ðŸŽ¨ Run Storybook

- Run storybook system design with `yarn storybook`

## ðŸ§¹ Linting

This app uses ESLint, Prettier, and lint-staged for code formatting and consistency.

To check for lint errors, run `yarn lint`.
